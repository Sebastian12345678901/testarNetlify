        The northern pike (Esox lucius), known simply as a pike in Britain,
        Ireland, most of Canada, and most parts of the United States (once
        called luce when fully grown; also called jackfish or simply "northern"
        in the U.S. Upper Midwest and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta,
        Manitoba and Saskatchewan), is a species of carnivorous fish of the
        genus Esox (the pikes). They are typical of brackish and fresh waters of
        the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. holarctic in distribution). Pike can grow
        to a relatively large size: the average length is about 40–55 cm (16–22
        in), with maximum recorded lengths of up to 150 cm (59 in) and published
        weights of 28.4 kg (63 lb).[2] The IGFA currently recognizes a 25 kg (55
        lb) pike caught by Lothar Louis on Greffern Lake, Germany, on 16 October
        1986, as the all-tackle world-record northern pike.[3]
